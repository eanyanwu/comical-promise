# comical-promise
A word-for-code Promises/A+ implementation


## Test it:
Assuming you have `npm` and `node` installed,

- `git clone https://github.com/hilarious-capital/comical-promise.git`
- `cd comical-promise`
- `npm install && npm run test`

## What is this?

A vanilla javascript Promise impelementation.
Its a word-for-word (or _word-for-code_ if you will) implementation of the [Promises/A+ specification](https://promisesaplus.com/), since that's what IN right now.

## Wherefore?

- I need a promise implementation for another project.
- I can't use the browser implementation since I have no guarantees on the browser version said project will run on.
- I am naive and I think I can skirt by with no 3rd-party `js` dependencies in said project (say NO :hand: to `node_modules`)
- Fun? :eyes:
